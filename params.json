Songs, calls and utterances are stored in databases - that is, their audio files, metadata about where they were recorded, who made them, etc, and measurements of their acoustic properties are all stored in the same easy-to-back-up place.\r\n\r\n### Measuring wildlife recordings.   \r\nLuscinia provides a flexible, fast and reliable way to semi-automatically measure bioacoustic signals. It measures 15 acoustic parameters as contours and hierarchical information about how complex signals are structured.\r\n\r\n### Analysing bioacoustic signals.    \r\nLuscinia implements a wide range of analytical methods, from exporting summary statistics to spreadsheets to its centrepiece: and advanced implementation of the dynamic time warping algorithm. This allows the comparison of disparate and complex signals, and forms the basis for a range of bioinformatic and statistical analyses: multidimensional scaling, dendrograms, geographic analysis, syntax analysis and more.\r\n\r\n### Luscinia has currently been used in more than 30 publications and is actively supported and developed. \r\n\r\nSpectrogram screen. Users can navigate in the lower \"Navigation panel\", and measure song elements in the main window. Luscinia provides a fully-featured spectrogram view with a flexible, semi-automated and efficient method to measure songs.\r\n![Spect](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rflachlan/Luscinia/master/Luscinia/images/SpectScreen.png)\r\n\r\nMDS plot of chaffinch syllables from a whole-population sample.
